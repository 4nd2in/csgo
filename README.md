# üéØ csgo
A backup for my most important files to run csgo properly

## üìù How to use them
Before installing any of the configs make sure to go to steam and open the csgo properties. Then add the following to the `Launch Options`

```
-novid -language colormod -refresh 240 +fps_max 0
```

### Autoexe
Copy and paste the autoexe file to this path: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg`

### Colormod
Copy and paste the colormod file to this path: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\resource`

### Config
This is just a backup of a working config. Do not copy this as the autoexec file will already create a config file
