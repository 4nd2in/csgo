# üéØ csgo/cs2
A backup for my most important files to run csgo/cs2 properly

## üìù CS2
Before installing any of the configs make sure to go to steam and open the csgo properties. Then add the following to the `Launch Options`

```
-high -language colormod +fps_max 0 +exec autoexec.cfg
```

- high: CS2 gets the highest priority from the computer
- langage: sets the language (colormod is a modified language)
- fps_max: sets the max fps (unlimited if value is 0)
- exec: executes a config

### Autoexe
Copy and paste the autoexe file to this path: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg`

### Video
Copy and past the video file to this path: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\XXXXXXXXX\730\local\cfg`

## üìù CS:GO
Before installing any of the configs make sure to go to steam and open the csgo properties. Then add the following to the `Launch Options`

```
-novid -high -language colormod +tickrate 128 +fps_max 0 +exec autoexec.cfg
```

- novid: the game launches without the short starting video
- high: CS:GO gets the highest priority from the computer
- langage: sets the language (colormod is a modified language)
- tickrate: sets the tickrate on local serverss to 128
- fps_max: sets the max fps (unlimited if value is 0)
- exec: executes a config

### Autoexe
